ARDUINO TO DM542 PIN MAPPING
=============================

CORRECTED VERSION - Common Cathode Configuration
-------------------------------------------------

Arduino Pins:
  D2 (Digital Pin 2) --> DIR+ (Direction Positive)
  D3 (Digital Pin 3) --> PUL+ (Pulse/Step Positive) [PWM capable]
  D4 (Digital Pin 4) --> ENA+ (Enable Positive)
  GND               --> DIR-, PUL-, ENA- (All negatives to ground)

Logic Levels:
  - Enable Motor:  D4 = HIGH (drives ENA+ high)
  - Disable Motor: D4 = LOW  (drives ENA+ low)
  - Step Forward:  D2 = LOW,  D3 = Pulse
  - Step Reverse:  D2 = HIGH, D3 = Pulse

DM542 Connections:
  A+, A-  --> Stepper Motor Coil A
  B+, B-  --> Stepper Motor Coil B
  DC+     --> Power Supply Positive (12-48V)
  DC-     --> Power Supply Negative/Ground

IMPORTANT NOTES:
1. D3 must be PWM capable for AccelStepper library
2. Common cathode means all negative terminals go to Arduino GND
3. Arduino drives the positive terminals directly (3.3V/5V logic)
4. DM542 optocouplers work with 3.3-5V signals
5. Emergency stop sets ENA+ LOW to disable motor

This configuration is simpler and more reliable than the 
common anode configuration as it doesn't require external pull-ups.
